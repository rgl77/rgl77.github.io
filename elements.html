									<h2>Analysis on F.R.I.E.N.D.S</h2>
									<div class="box">
										<p>I am a huge fan of the FRIENDS sitcom. This is long overdue and it would a shame if I didn't do anything fun with FRIENDS. It was a data exploratory project where I used Python's nltk library and IBM Watson's NLU API to calculate the general sentiment of lead characters to match what I got from the sitcom by watching it. It was interesting to see the patterns from the transcript and there was a flaw in my sentiment computation. After lemmatizing the transcript for lead characters, detecting sarcasm and other undirect sentiments where impossible because that would require understanding of the context from transcript. Future directions would be trying to find correlation between sentiments and character appearances. That way, we will be able to predict in-scene characters from transcript.    </p>

									<h2>Attribute prediction on network</h2>
									<div class="box">
										<p>Used local smoothing techniques on protein-protein interaction network to predict attributes. The attributes were the amount of anti-bodies found in a specific node(genome). 20 different anti-bodies were all related to various cancers.</p>
